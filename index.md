### CPSC 120

* Lab 10

    Lab 10, part 1 was one of my favorites because we were looking at all the counties and populations in the state of California. It was intresting to see all the counties because there were a few that I havnt seen before. This lab helped me understand and use a two dementional data structure to find a county in California and to organize them by population. 

* Lab 3
    
    Lab 3 part 1 was one of my favorites becuase we were calculating the BMR and the total calories the Rock, Simone Biles, and Kobe Bryant have to take per day. Another reason why this lab is one of my favorites is because I am an athlete so I need to know how many calories I need to take daily. For this lab we preacticed working and writing a funtion definiton and by doing this lab and how it connected to me, I learned more about function definitions. 

* Lab 4

    lab 4 part 1 was one of my favorites because of the converson rates from mL to cups. This one was intresting to me because I also bake when I have the time. It was fun finding out how many mL go into a cup. With this lab I was ablr to understand and use doubles better.
